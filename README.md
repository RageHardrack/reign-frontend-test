# Frontend test: Hacker News

This is a technical task to show my skills in frontend development. The web application request data to the [Hackers News public API](https://hn.algolia.com/api). The dropdown selector component use the URL parameter “query” from the “search by date” API in order to filter the posts.

## Stack

- NextJS with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Jest
- DayJS

## Getting Started

First, install all packages using yarn.

```bash
yarn install
```

### Start Development environment

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Execute Tests

```bash
yarn test
```

## Functionality

- [ ] The selected filter should persist on the local storage.
- [ ] The favorited posts should persist on the local storage.
- [ ] The web app is expected to work as a responsive web application.
- [ ] If you decide to implement the pagination component, it should behave like [this](https://material-ui.com/components/pagination/).
- [ ] When clicking on the row, a new tab should be open with the link of the post (story_url).
- [ ] Clicking on the “like button” should not trigger the opening of the post URL link.
- [ ] When hovering on the row, apply opacity to the entire row and its children (texts, icons, like button, etc).
